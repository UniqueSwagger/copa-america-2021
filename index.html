                            America 2021 at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is Argentina's first
                            title since 1993 and 15th Copa America title.

                            Angel Di Maria's 22nd minute strike proved enough as the Albiceleste showed great composure
                            and determination in defence to keep the Selecao out, a feat none of the teams have achieved
                            in this edition of the tournament..</p>
